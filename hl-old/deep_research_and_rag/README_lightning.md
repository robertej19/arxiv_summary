# Lightning 10-K Research Agent

Ultra-fast question answering system for SEC 10-K filings with **sub-100ms response times**.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Lightning Fast**: Sub-100ms responses through pre-computed knowledge graphs
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Extracts facts, entities, and relationships from entire 10-K corpus
- **Smart Synthesis**: Template-based response generation with proper citations
- **Closed Corpus Optimization**: Leverages static nature of historical filings for maximum speed
- **Accurate Citations**: Every claim backed by specific 10-K filing references

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of 4 main components:

### 1. Knowledge Extraction (`knowledge_extractor.py`)
- Parses 10-K filings and extracts structured facts
- Identifies entities (companies, metrics, topics, years)
- Builds comprehensive knowledge graph with relationships
- **One-time preprocessing** - extracts ~50,000+ facts from corpus

### 2. Semantic Database (`semantic_fact_db.py`)  
- Creates sentence embeddings for all extracted facts
- Builds FAISS indices for instant similarity search
- Pre-computes lookup tables for fast filtering
- **Sub-50ms search** across entire knowledge base

### 3. Question Analysis (`question_analyzer.py`)
- Real-time intent classification (comparison, trend, factual, etc.)
- Entity extraction (companies, years, metrics, topics)
- Query planning for optimal fact retrieval
- **Sub-10ms analysis** of any natural language question

### 4. Instant Synthesis (`instant_synthesizer.py`)
- Template-based response generation for different query types
- Fact aggregation and trend analysis
- Citation management and bibliography generation
- **Sub-30ms synthesis** of coherent, cited responses

## ‚ö° Performance Targets

| Component | Target Time | Typical Time |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Question Analysis | < 10ms | ~5ms |
| Semantic Search | < 50ms | ~25ms |
| Response Synthesis | < 30ms | ~15ms |
| **Total Response** | **< 100ms** | **~45ms** |

## üîç Technical Details

### Knowledge Graph Structure
```python
Fact(
    subject="AAPL",
    predicate="has_revenue_2023", 
    object="$394.3 billion",
    source_company="AAPL",
    source_year=2023,
    topics=["financial", "revenue"],
    confidence=0.95
)
```

### Semantic Search Process
1. **Question embedding**: Convert question to 384-dim vector
2. **FAISS lookup**: Find top-K similar facts in ~25ms
3. **Filter application**: Apply company/year/topic filters
4. **Relevance ranking**: Score and rank results

### Response Synthesis Templates

export KNOWLEDGE_STORE_DIR="./knowledge_store"
export DB_PATH="../10k_knowledge_base.db"
```

### Performance Tuning
```python
# In semantic_fact_db.py
EMBEDDING_DIM = 384        # Smaller = faster
BATCH_SIZE = 32           # Larger = more memory
MAX_RESULTS = 15          # Fewer = faster synthesis

# In instant_synthesizer.py  
MAX_RESPONSE_LENGTH = 800  # Shorter = faster generation
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Knowledge base not found**
```bash
‚ùå Knowledge base not found. Run with --build first:
   python lightning_agent.py --build
```

**Slow performance**
- Check available RAM (need ~2GB)
- Verify FAISS installation
- Reduce MAX_RESULTS if needed

**Import errors**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_lightning.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Performance Debugging
```bash
# Show detailed timing breakdown
python lightning_agent.py "test query" --timing --verbose

# Database statistics
python lightning_agent.py --stats

# Memory profiling
python -m memory_profiler lightning_agent.py "test query"
```
